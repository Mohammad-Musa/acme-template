## ACME-TEMPLATE

This project was build in order to train HTML 5 semantics and responsive HTML/CSS design.

Furthermore, the idea is to train the concept of branching in GIT, so each step of the project was build in a new branch.

For the full development strategy of the project, please read [this](development-strategy.md) document.
